## Inheritance
Process of which on object acquired all properties and behaviors of another object (parent object).
	
## Polymorphism
	
Capability to provide multiple implementations of an action and to select the correct implementation based on the surrounding context.
Feature that allows one interface to be used for general class actions. In other word, one task is performed in different ways.
	- Method overloading
	- Method overriding	

## Data Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding together code and data into single unit. The purpose is keep it safe from outside interface or misuse.
	 
## Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality. Represent essential feature without including background details or explanation
